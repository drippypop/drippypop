### 🚀 About Me

Hey! I’m Drippypop, a developer with a passion for blending music, games, and code into unique interactive experiences. I love creating tools for developers and designing gameplay that revolves around music.

- 💻 **Tech Stack**: I primarily work with JavaScript, Unity, and Lua.
- 🎮 **Game Development**: Currently developing *Soundwave 64*, a rhythm-based action game where elemental powers sync with the beat.
- 🎨 **NPM Projects**: I built **ShadowDB** to make database management simpler and more intuitive.

### 🛠️ Projects

- **Soundwave 64**: A 3D action rhythm game that combines music with elemental powers.  
- **[ShadowDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shadowdb)**: A fast, developer-friendly database manager with support for batch operations, transactions, and more.
